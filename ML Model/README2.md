# URL Classification Project

## Overview
This project aims to classify URLs into different types (benign, defacement, phishing, malware) using various machine learning models. The project involves feature extraction from URLs and evaluating multiple classifiers to identify the best-performing model.

## Dataset
The dataset contains URLs and their corresponding types:
- **URL**: The URL to be classified.
- **Type**: The type of the URL (benign, defacement, phishing, malware).

## Project Structure
- `import_libraries.py`: Script to import necessary libraries.
- `define_functions.py`: Script defining functions for feature extraction from URLs.
- `process_data.py`: Script to load, clean, and preprocess the data.
- `train_model.py`: Script to train and evaluate machine learning models.
- `model_selection.py`: Script to evaluate multiple classifiers and identify the best-performing model.

## Data Processing
### Feature Extraction
The features are extracted from the URLs using functions defined in `define_functions.py`. These features include various characteristics of the URLs that help in classification.

### Data Splitting
The data is split into training and testing sets to evaluate model performance.

## Model Selection and Training
### Models Used
The following classifiers were evaluated:
- DecisionTreeClassifier
- RandomForestClassifier
- AdaBoostClassifier
- KNeighborsClassifier
- ExtraTreesClassifier
- GaussianNB
- XGBClassifier
- LGBMClassifier
- SVC

### Hyperparameter Tuning
- The XGBClassifier was used with specific parameters to enhance performance.
- The LGBMClassifier was instantiated with verbosity reduced to disable logs.

### Evaluation Method
The models were evaluated using 5-fold cross-validation. The performance metrics included accuracy, recall, precision, and F1 score.

## Results
### Performance Metrics
The XGBClassifier outperformed the other models with the highest accuracy and balanced performance across all metrics.

### Visualizations
- **Classifier Accuracy Comparison**: A bar plot showing the accuracy of each classifier.
- **Confusion Matrix**: Visual representation of the true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives.
- **ROC Curve and AUC**: Evaluates the modelâ€™s ability to distinguish between classes.

## Discussion
### Interpretation of Results
- The XGBClassifier demonstrated superior performance in classifying URLs, making it the best choice for this task.

### Model Strengths and Weaknesses
- **Strengths**: High accuracy, good balance between precision and recall.
- **Weaknesses**: Occasionally predicts false positives.

### Business Implications
- This model can be used to identify malicious URLs, enhancing security measures for users effectively.

### Future Work
- Further exploration of other algorithms and more extensive hyperparameter tuning.
- Incorporation of additional features and larger datasets to improve model robustness.
